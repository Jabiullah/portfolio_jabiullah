                                In online shopping, customers must share personal details like home addresses, phone numbers, and house information with shop owners and delivery organizations. This poses security risks as it becomes challenging to monitor or trace the usage of this sensitive information. Once shared, customers lose control over their data, leading to potential security breaches.

                                Bangladesh's agricultural sector faces severe challenges due to high loan interest rates, lengthy paperwork, and inadequate risk management. These issues make it difficult for farmers to secure the necessary funds for cultivation, leading many to abandon farming, which threatens the country's economy.

                                The proposed solution, Krishok Bondhu, introduces a Grow-Now-Pay-Later (GNPL) policy. This system allows farmers to acquire essential agricultural products like seeds and fertilizer without immediate full payment. Instead, they can repay the costs after harvest, reducing financial stress and encouraging continuous cultivation.

                            Implementing the Krishok Bondhu system has the potential to revolutionize agriculture in Bangladesh by providing farmers with the financial flexibility to continue their work without the burden of high-interest loans. This approach stabilizes farmers' incomes and promotes sustainable agricultural practices, significantly enhancing the livelihoods of millions of farmers in rural areas.

                            This research investigates the widespread tendency of users to ignore Privacy Policy during app installations, aiming to understand the underlying causes and real-world consequences of this behavior.

                            Ignoring Privacy Policy can lead to significant issues such as data privacy breaches, financial implications, and legal liabilities. An example highlighted is an incident in Karnataka, where an engineering student faced severe consequences due to unawareness of the app's data access, ultimately leading to blackmail and tragedy. Addressing this problem is crucial for enhancing user awareness, protecting privacy, and ensuring informed consent in the digital environment.

                            The research employs a mixed-method strategy, combining surveys and interviews to explore user attitudes and behaviors toward Privacy Policy. By analyzing the reasons behind Privacy Policy neglect, the study aims to propose solutions that improve readability and engagement. One suggested approach includes using graphical representations of Privacy Policy to make them more accessible and understandable, thus encouraging users to read and comprehend these crucial documents before agreeing.
