                                In online shopping, customers must share personal details like home addresses, phone numbers, and house information with shop owners and delivery organizations. This poses security risks as it becomes challenging to monitor or trace the usage of this sensitive information. Once shared, customers lose control over their data, leading to potential security breaches.

                                Bangladesh's agricultural sector faces severe challenges due to high loan interest rates, lengthy paperwork, and inadequate risk management. These issues make it difficult for farmers to secure the necessary funds for cultivation, leading many to abandon farming, which threatens the country's economy.

                                The proposed solution, Krishok Bondhu, introduces a <strong>Grow-Now-Pay-Later (GNPL)</strong> policy. This system allows farmers to acquire essential agricultural products like seeds and fertilizer without immediate full payment. Instead, they can repay the costs after harvest, reducing financial stress and encouraging continuous cultivation.

                            Implementing the Krishok Bondhu system has the potential to revolutionize agriculture in Bangladesh by providing farmers with the financial flexibility to continue their work without the burden of high-interest loans. This approach stabilizes farmers' incomes and promotes sustainable agricultural practices, significantly enhancing the livelihoods of millions of farmers in rural areas.

                            I conducted an exploratory HCI study on purpose-driven location sharing in Bangladesh, examining how smartphone users manage control, trust, and safety when sharing location information for everyday needs such as deliveries, transportation, and social coordination. I studied how users frequently rely on informal workarounds—such as typing addresses, sharing landmarks, images, or voice notes—due to usability and control limitations in existing platforms. I analyzed how shared location data becomes difficult to retract once disclosed, leading to concerns about misuse, screenshots, and long-term data retention. I also investigated gendered experiences of location sharing and found that women and gender-diverse users adopt additional precautionary strategies yet continue to experience heightened discomfort and safety risks. Through this research, I identified key socio-technical gaps in current location-sharing systems and highlighted design opportunities for more context-aware, trust-sensitive, and gender-inclusive solutions in HCI.
